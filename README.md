# Fog-of-war-overlay
basic start into a "fog of war" effect for website overlay


With a graphic in the background, there is a 'fog' overlay that makes it difficult to make out the graphic properly. 
On top of the fog is a login panel - this example does not have a working login panel - that is fully visible and
as if floating on top of the 'fog'.
As you move the mouse around, you find that is clears the 'fog' and allows you to see that area of the under lying 
graphic problem or haze.

This is a first step prototype. Much more work would be needed before production. This was an exercise to attack 
the challenge and allow for better planning in the future if development was decided upon.
